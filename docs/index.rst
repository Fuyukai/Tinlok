Kotlin/Native STandard library Extensions
=========================================

KNSTE is a library providing the missing 75% of the Kotlin/Native Desktop standard library.

KNSTE focuses on **usability** and **correctness**, *not* simplicity. Computers are complicated
and we don't pretend otherwise, but KNSTE tries to make that complication as easy to use as
possible.

Vital statistics:

* Supported operating systems:

  - Linux (AMD64, AArch64)
  - MacOS (AMD64)
  - Windows (AMD64)
  - With your help, others!

* Dually licensed under the LGPL 3.0 (or later) and the MPL 2.0
