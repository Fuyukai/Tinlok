Tinlok
======

Tinlok is a library providing the missing 75% of the Kotlin/Native Desktop standard library.

Tinlok focuses on **usability** and **correctness**, *not* simplicity. Computers are complicated
and we don't pretend otherwise, but Tinlok tries to make that complication as easy to use as
possible.
