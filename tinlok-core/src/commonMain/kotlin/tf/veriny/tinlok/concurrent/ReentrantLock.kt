/**
 * A simple re-entrant lock that can be used to synchronise resources concurrently. This lock is
 * light-weight (using a pthreads futex or a Windows critical section), and re-entrant (so that
 * the same thread can obtain it multiple times without deadlocking).
 *
 * Locks are intended to be allocated globally once and then shared between workers. However, since
 * they hold on to an external resource, they can be closed (at which point the underlying lock
 * becomes invalid), but this is not normally needed. Avoid using locks in instance variables, for
 * example.
 *
 * To obtain the lock, use the [withLocked] function.
